# my-personal-page
A basic personal page that has links to my LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub, Freecodecamp accounts. It enables  the user to send me a message. (Note: It is still under construction!)

In order to see the original place where I started writing this page, please have a look at my codepen link shared in the description above.
Built using HTML and styling is done a CSS.
